	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
        <p>Given the journalistic integrity of The Guardian, the overall quality of the Winter Olympic data set is very good.
        Care was clearly taken to ensure the data was presented correctly and the active data science community at Kaggle provided
        an additional degree of vetting to check the data against any inconsistencies that may have existed.</p>
      </div>

    
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
	<p>Given the somewhat scattered nature of historic Olympic data, this data set is very complete and comprehensive. That being said,
	it is also helpful that we were able to cross-reference any suspicious data point against multiple free online sources. For
	example, <a href = "https://www.olympic.org/olympic-games">the Olympics website</a> also includes information on all historic medal 
	winners and maintains data on past host cities. </p>

	</div>
	
	<p>While our data is very complete, we do note that we lack data on years between 1938 and 1942, inclusive. Upon looking into
	this notable omission, we realized that the Winter Games had been cancelled during these years, for the obvious reason of WWII. It 
	was also interesting going through our analysis to see that one of the top performing nations with respect to medal count during the late 1960s through 1980s
	completely fell out of the rankings during more recent years. Again, upon examining our data, we found that this nation was the USSR,
	which dissolved into modern-day Russia between 1990 and 1991. We check both of these historical abnormalities in our data against
	history texts online to verify our conclusions explaining the missingness in our data. 
	</p>
      </div>
      
 <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
	<p>This data is coherent in the sense that it lacks inconsistencies outside of the few notable omissions as mentioned above.
	While the data in its original format proved somewhat challenging to analyze, after using Wrangler to re-orient our data,
	we found that all values seemed to fall within the range of reasonable parameters. For example, our intuition surrounding the
	most decorated countries leads us to believe that nations that receive more snow on average should likely perform better in the 
	Winter Olympics. Our plots and unlisted summary statistics supported this assumption. Similarly, we would anticipate that
	most Olympians only win one or two medals over the course of their Olympic career while those who win more go down in history
	as athletic heroes and national role models. To check this assumption, we compiled a list of the top ten most decorated Winter Olympians
	and verified that these individuals were indeed the best in their respective sports at the time of their athletic careers. Furthermore,
	we noted that no individual earned more than 13 medals, which is precisely the quantity of medal awarded to the most decorated Winter Olympian, 
	Ole Einar Bj√∏rndalen from Norway. </p>
	
	<p>We also would expect the Winter Olympics to fall every four years. While we acknowledged the missing data points for 1938 and 1942 above,
	we note a slight irregulatiry during the early 1990s. Between 1992 and 1994, the Winter Olympics appear to have been held twice. We initially
	believed that this was a data entry error, but upon consulting the Olympic history records again, we realized that the Games were indeed held
	during both of these years in order to offset the Winter and Summer Olympics by two years. Similarly, logic would tell us that there should be
	a relatively equal number of types medals assigned. The plot below shows that this is not entirely true:

	<p>
	Although the number of bronze, silver, and gold medals awarded is not identical, this discrepancy is likely due to 
	the team sports in the Games such as figure skating and bobsled, which may include alternates who earn a medal regardless
	of their participation in the competition.
	</p>
</div>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
	<p>The data that The Guardian compiled and uploaded to Kaggle appears to be correct. To verify the data, I researched
	other <a href = "https://www.olympic.org/">online collections of Olympic records</a> and informally compared the results between the two. While the format of The
	Guardian's data set differs slightly, this variation is only to accomodate clean entry into a data table and stream-lined
	data manipulation and analysis. While it is theoretically possible that the Olympic Committee falsified some of the data on
	their website in order to convey some political message, the information on Olympic medalists is available on countless 
	websites and doing so would seriously jeopardize the legitimacy of the Committee's mission to promote peace and respect between nations.
