	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
        <p>Given the journalistic integrity of The Guardian, the overall quality of the Winter Olympic data set is very good.
        Care was clearly taken to ensure the data was presented correctly and the active data science community at Kaggle provided
        an additional degree of vetting to check the data against any inconsistencies that may have existed.</p>
      </div>

    
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
	<p>Given the somewhat scattered nature of historic Olympic data, this data set is very complete and comprehensive. That being said,
	it is also helpful that we were able to cross-reference any suspicious data point against multiple free online sources. For
	example, <a href = "https://www.olympic.org/olympic-games">the Olympics website</a> also includes information on all historic medal 
	winners and maintains data on past host cities. </p>
	<p>While our data is very complete, we do note that we lack data on years between 1938 and 1942, inclusive. Upon looking into
	this notable omission, we realized that the Winter Games had been cancelled during these years, for the obvious reason of WWII. It 
	was also interesting going through our analysis to see that one of the top performing nations with respect to medal count during the late 1960s through 1980s
	completely fell out of the rankings during more recent years. Again, upon examining our data, we found that this nation was the USSR,
	which dissolved into modern-day Russia between 1990 and 1991. We check both of these historical abnormalities in our data against
	history texts online to verify our conclusions explaining the missingness in our data.

	<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
	<p>This data is coherent in the sense that it lacks inconsistencies outside of the few notable omissions as mentioned above.
	While the data in its original format proved somewhat challenging to analyze, after using Wrangler to re-orient our data,
	we found that all values seemed to fall within the range of reasonable parameters. For example, our intuition surrounding the
	most decorated countries leads us to believe that nations that receive more snow on average should likely perform better in the 
	Winter Olympics. Our plots and unlisted summary statistics supported this assumption. Similarly, we would anticipate that
	most Olympians only win one or two medals over the course of their Olympic career while those who win more go down in history
	as athletic heroes and national role models. To check this assumption, we compiled a list of the top ten most decorated Winter Olympians
	and verified that these individuals were indeed the best in their respective sports at the time of their athletic careers. Furthermore,
	we noted that no individual earned more than 13 medals, which is precisely the quantity of medal awarded to the most decorated Winter Olympian, 
	Ole Einar Bj√∏rndalen from Norway. </p>
	<p
	Does it make sense relative to itself? Does it match your
	expectations? Are the distributions sensible? What is your
	evidence for this?</p>

	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
	<p>Given that the Olympic Committee would gain little, if nothing, by lying about the medal
	winners of the past, we can assume that 
	
	What aspects of this data can you verify? How did you do so? What did
	you find?</p>
